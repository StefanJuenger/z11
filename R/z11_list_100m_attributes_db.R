#' List 1 hectare attributes of the German Census 2011
#'
#' This function lists all attributes of the German Census 2011 with a raster
#' resolution of 1 hectare. These data were the last that have been published.
#' While they comprise more attributes than the 1 kmÂ² ones, the data were
#' prepared in a less easy to be used format. Note that the returned vector
#' of attribute names includes the attribute names as they were defined by the
#' Census folks plus a pattern denoting the code of the attribute in the
#' original dumped CSV file.
