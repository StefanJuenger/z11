\description{
This function lists all attributes of the German Census 2011 with a raster
resolution of 1 hectare. These data were the last that have been published.
While they comprise more attributes than the 1 kmÂ² ones, the data were
prepared in a less easy to be used format. Note that the returned vector
of attribute names includes the attribute names as they were defined by the
Census folks plus a pattern denoting the code of the attribute in the
original dumped CSV file.
